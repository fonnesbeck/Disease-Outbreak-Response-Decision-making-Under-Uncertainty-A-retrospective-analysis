The effective reproduction number $R_e$, which describes the rate at which the epidemic spread in 1997 in a partially immune population, was estimated to be clearly greater than 1 for on both 15 June and 15 July using the age confirmation model (Figure 4). Notably, while the posterior mean estimate for $R_e$ on 15 June was 1.125, the 95\% credible did include the estimate that results from including the data through 15 July. Ignoring the age
confirmation model and treating all clinical cases as measles cases yielded a 15 June estimate of $R_e$ = 1.02 with a 95\% credible interval
(0.95-1.08) that includes 1. Using all data through 15 July, the estimate of the $R_e$ was comparable, irrespective of whether clinical cases were corrected using the age confirmation model or not.
