\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Data}}{Data}}\label{data}

Case-based records of individuals presenting with clinical measles symptoms (fever, rash, and at least one of the following symptoms: cough, conjunctivitis, or coryza \cite{Hutchins_2004}) during the calendar year of 1996 were provided by the \textit{Ministério da Saúde} (Ministry of Health) in Brazil. Fields for each record included the county in which the case presented, reporting date, age in months or years, and the results (positive, negative, or inconclusive) of a serological test for measles specific IgM, if one was conducted. After limiting the data to cases presenting in urban S\~{a}o Paulo and discarding those with incomplete records, there were 10,810 cases presenting with clinical symptoms only
and 23,699 cases with serological tests, of which 1067 were discarded due to lack of reagent or improper collection and thus treated as clinical cases.

The age distribution of the population in Sao Paulo was extrapolated from the decadal census. Historical rates of routine vaccination coverage were taken from (http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A826).
