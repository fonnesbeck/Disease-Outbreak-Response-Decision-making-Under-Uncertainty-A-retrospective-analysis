For supplemental immunization, rather than assuming a fixed 20\% residual susceptibility during the years 1984 and 1991, we sampled the value from a uniform distribution between 0.2 and 0.325, reflecting the possibility that the residual susceptibility could be higher (but not lower) than the number used in the model.

The result of these added priors was to increase the uncertainty in estimates of population susceptibility for the lab confirmation model, but not the clinical confirmation model (Figure A2).
