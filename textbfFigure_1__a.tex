The probability of a clinical case being confirmed by positive IgM serology was strongly age dependent (Figure 2). Clinical cases less than 20y were significantly more likely to be IgM negative (posterior mean between 27\%-42\%, Figure 2); individuals between age 20-40y were significantly more likely to be IgM positive (\textgreater{}50\%). The consequence of this bias is that the observed age distribution of clinical cases over-represents the number and proportion of childhood cases.
