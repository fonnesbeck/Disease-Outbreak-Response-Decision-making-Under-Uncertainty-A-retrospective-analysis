\textbf{Alternative contact matrix structure}

To evaluate the sensitivity of our results to the assumed structure in contact rates among age groups, we fit an alternative model using a simplified network. Rather than have contact decline exponentially with the difference in age between groups, we here assumed that between-group contact was constant, governed by a coefficient $\rho$ that is applied to all off-diagonal elements of the matrix:

\begin{equation}
B = \left[{
\begin{array}{cccc}
  {\beta} & {\beta \rho} & \ldots &  {\beta \rho}  \\
  {\beta \rho} & {\beta} & \ldots &  {\beta \rho} \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \ddots  & \vdots \\
  {\beta \rho} & {\beta \rho} & \ldots & {\beta}  \\
\end{array}
}\right]
\end{equation}

The resulting estimates of vaccination thresholds based on this contact structure is shown in Figure A3. The estimates are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the estimates based on a decaying inter-age contact assumption (Figure 5).
