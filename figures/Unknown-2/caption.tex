\textbf{Figure 5}: A comparison of the estimated immunization threshold that would be achieved by four vaccination strategies (each targeting different age classes) to the minimum vaccination threshold necessary to reduce the effective reproduction number below one. Estimates of the necessary threshold and 95\% credible interval are shown by black lines and grey regions, respectively, based on data available on 15 June and 15 July for the age-confirmation and clinical only models. Colored rectangles give the 95\% credible intervals for the estimated immunization achieved by each of the 4 vaccination strategies. If the estimated immunization achieved by a campaign is higher than the minimum vaccination threshold required, then the campaign is assumed to be sufficient to stop the outbreak.
