\subsection{Evaluating Outbreak Response Campaigns}\label{ori}

The classic result states that a fraction \(p_c \gt 1-1/R_e\) of susceptibles must be immunized (i.e. vaccinated and seroconverted) in order to reduce \(R_e \lt 1\) \cite{Anderson_1981}. Young children are conventionally targeted in outbreak response vaccination campaigns because they are, on average, more likely to be susceptible and to experience severe complications because of measles infection. In populations with a long history of measles
control, the age distribution of susceptibles is frequently wider \cite{Ferrari_2013} and wider age campaigns are often considered to reach larger proportion of susceptibles. As \(R_e\) , and thus the \(p_c\), increases, then one might target a wider age range to increase the proportion of susceptibles immunized for a given coverage. Here, both the estimate of \(R_e\) and the age distribution of susceptibles is conditional on both date of the estimate (June or July) and the model used (all clinical cases or age-corrected). For each model, we calculated the necessary vaccination threshold assuming a campaign that achieves 90\% coverage of the target population and 95\% efficacy. We then evaluated whether there would have been empirical support on 15 June or 15 July that outbreak response campaigns targeting individuals from 6m-5y, 6m-15y, 6m-30y, or a mixed strategy targeting children 6m-5y and adults 20-30y would have met this necessary target.
